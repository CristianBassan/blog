			<h2 id="content">A bit of my story</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Resistencia, Chaco, Argentina.

			<p>At an early age I found myself learning concepts in ever-increasing complexity to solve problems, mainly
				to build things in video games. That has prompted me to study Electromechanical Engineering at the
				Universidad Nacional del Nordeste, located in my hometown. I am currently in the final stretch of my
				studies, with my first potential graduation date at the end of this year, 2024. </p>

			<p>To stay motivated during my academic training, I have embarked on projects of varying nature, which has
				led me to learn a wide range of branches of knowledge, often not strictly linked to electromechanical
				engineering. Personally, I believe that this fact has given me relative ease in learning new concepts
				and being able to quickly learn and apply different concepts to solve a problem.</p>

			<p>I think it is important to never lose the capacity of amazement and curiosity, and I hope to spark those
				feelings in all the people who find this profile through my publications. Don't hesitate to ask and/or
				get in touch!</p>
