			<h2 id="content">The idea:</h2>
			<p>Small displacement internal combustion engines from motorbikes are used to compete in go-kart races all
				around the country of Argentina. The fact that the air intake faces the rear of the vehicle
				prompted me to design a duct that redirects the flow, taking advantage of the air's relative speed and lower temperatures to
				increase flow.</p>
			<p>Motivation comes from the application of Bernoulli equations and common sense, after watching other
				competitors use aftermarket intake trumpets facing the wrong direction.</p>
			<p>After the design was completed, a Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation was used to validate the
				initial proposal.</p>

				<h4>CFD Simulation considerations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Constant linear speed of 80 kph</li>
					<li>Intake valve opening and closing calculated and simulated</li>


				</ul>

			</div>

			<h2 id="content">Results:</h2>
			<p>Simulation results shown an air mass flow increase of ~13%. Concluding that the design met it's
				purpose, and an increase in engine power is to be expected after proper carburetor tuning.</p>
